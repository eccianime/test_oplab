Greetings,
There are only two commits in this repository.
One is for the General Questions and the other for the Front-End Exam.

Note that there's a file named "Oplab interview" where it shows the questions.

I recommend (because that's what I did) to put the php files in another place, like a www/ or htdocs/ whichever is your SO, and run from a PHP module.

Those php files are:
-Oplab interview 	
-bubble.php 	
-game_of_stones.php 	
-linkedList.php 
-out.txt 	
-txt.txt

Each file may be read and executed individually, except "game_of_stones.php" which it needs "txt.txt" and "out.txt".
The reason I made it this way is beacause when I was testing it, it was more comfortable to work with two separate files instead of one.

For the evaluation I admit I didn't finish one of the assignments because I had troubles activating my twitter developer account. It seems it was asking for a phone number and I didn't find a workaround for it, so I continued with the rest of the test.

Thanks for reading.
