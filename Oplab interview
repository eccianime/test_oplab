Hi! If you wanna work with us, you gotta solve this first. Let's see what you've got!
Instructions

    This test should be forked, worked on, and then commited to Github, with every comment in english.
    Every applicant should solve all the general questions.
    An applicant must solve frontend questions if applying for a frontend position.
    An applicant must solve backend questions if applying for a backend position.
    Solving both, is a bonus :)
    When you finish this test, send an e-mail containing the repository link and the salary expectations to hungryforthisjob@oplab.com.br

Frontend

We will be evaluating everything, from reproduction accuracy, to process. If you use ( with mastery ) tools/frameworks such as gulp, react, angular, webpack, etc..; we will take that in consideration. Also: we care about beautiful code (var) space_invader

Reproduce, faithfully, this page.
Backend

I know, I know... It looks easy compared to the frontend challenge; but don't be fooled! We expect more from your answers in here! We will evaluate how you answer, and your answer's organization and structure!

Answer the following questions:

    Suppose you're working with 3 people on a project. What would be the ideal software development process?
    How do you think an entity relationship diagram for Instagram would be like?
    Now that you have imagined the ER diagram, how would you build Instagram from scratch?

That's it! Thanks for doing this test!
